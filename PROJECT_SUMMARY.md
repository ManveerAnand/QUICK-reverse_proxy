## 🚀 Current Capabilities

### Load Balancing Algorithms
1. **Round Robin** - Distributes requests evenly across backends
2. **Least Connections** - Routes to backend with fewest active connections
3. **Weighted** - Distributes based on configured backend weights

### Health Checking
- HTTP-based health checks with configurable endpoints
- Consecutive success/failure thresholds
- Automatic backend removal/restoration based on health status
- Configurable check intervals and timeouts

### Metrics Available
- `quic_connections_total` - Total QUIC connections established
- `quic_connections_active` - Currently active QUIC connections
- `quic_handshakes_total` - Total handshake attempts
- `quic_handshake_duration_seconds` - Handshake latency histogram
- `quic_bytes_sent_total` - Total bytes sent via QUIC
- `quic_bytes_received_total` - Total bytes received via QUIC
- `http_requests_total` - Total HTTP requests by method and status
- `http_request_duration_seconds` - Request latency histogram
- `backend_health_status` - Health status per backend (1=healthy, 0=unhealthy)
- `backend_requests_total` - Requests distributed per backend

### Configuration Options
- Server listening address and TLS certificates
- QUIC-specific settings (max streams, timeouts, keep-alive)
- Backend target lists with health check configuration
- Load balancer algorithm selection
- Telemetry configuration (metrics, tracing, logging)
- Per-backend timeouts and retry counts

## 🔧 Build Information

**Language**: Go 1.21+
**Binary Size**: ~19MB (stripped)
**Dependencies**:
- github.com/quic-go/quic-go v0.40.0
- github.com/prometheus/client_golang v1.17.0
- go.opentelemetry.io/otel v1.19.0
- github.com/sirupsen/logrus v1.9.3
- gopkg.in/yaml.v3 v3.0.1

## 🎯 Use Cases

1. **HTTP/3 Gateway** - Provide HTTP/3 access to legacy HTTP/1.1 backends
2. **Load Balancer** - Distribute traffic across multiple backend services
3. **API Gateway** - Route and monitor API requests with full telemetry
4. **Microservices Proxy** - Service mesh entry point with health checking
5. **Development Proxy** - Test HTTP/3 applications locally

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Quick Test (Windows)
```powershell
# Run the test script
.\test-proxy.ps1
```

### Manual Start
```bash
# 1. Build
go build -o build/quic-proxy.exe ./cmd/proxy

# 2. Generate certificates (if not exists)
mkdir certs
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout certs/server.key -out certs/server.crt -days 365 -nodes

# 3. Start backend
python -m http.server 8080

# 4. Run proxy
./build/quic-proxy.exe -config configs/proxy.yaml -debug
```

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### QUIC Benefits
- **0-RTT Connection Establishment** - Reduced latency for repeat connections
- **Multiplexing Without Head-of-Line Blocking** - Better performance on lossy networks
- **Connection Migration** - Maintains connections during network changes
- **Built-in Encryption** - TLS 1.3 by default

### Optimizations Implemented
- Connection pooling for backend requests
- Atomic operations for concurrent access
- Efficient metrics collection with minimal overhead
- Structured logging with configurable levels
- Graceful shutdown with connection draining

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Potential)

### High Priority
- [ ] Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- [ ] Configuration hot reload without restart
- [ ] Rate limiting per client/backend
- [ ] Circuit breaker pattern for failing backends
- [ ] Request/response caching layer

### Medium Priority
- [ ] gRPC backend support
- [ ] WebSocket proxying
- [ ] Advanced routing rules (path-based, header-based)
- [ ] API for dynamic configuration updates
- [ ] Dashboard UI for monitoring

### Low Priority
- [ ] Request transformation/manipulation
- [ ] Response compression
- [ ] Request authentication/authorization
- [ ] Geo-based routing
- [ ] A/B testing support

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Platform Support**: Primarily tested on Windows; Linux/macOS testing needed
2. **HTTP/2 Fallback**: Currently no automatic fallback to HTTP/2 for incompatible clients
3. **Dynamic Configuration**: Requires restart to apply configuration changes
4. **Certificate Management**: Manual certificate generation and renewal
5. **Testing Coverage**: Unit tests not yet implemented

## 📝 Development Notes

### Key Design Decisions
- **HTTP/3 Only**: Focused on QUIC/HTTP3; no HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 support
- **Single Binary**: All-in-one executable for easy deployment
- **YAML Configuration**: Human-readable, easy to version control
- **Prometheus Metrics**: Industry-standard monitoring integration
- **OpenTelemetry**: Future-proof distributed tracing

### Code Organization
- Clean separation between protocol (QUIC), proxy logic, and telemetry
- Dependency injection for testing and flexibility
- Context propagation for request tracing
- Graceful error handling with detailed logging
