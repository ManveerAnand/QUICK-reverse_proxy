## 🎯 Why This Project Exists

### The Internet is Slow (Sometimes)

Imagine you're ordering food online:
- You click "Order Now"
- You wait... and wait...
- Finally, after 3 seconds, your order goes through

**What happened during those 3 seconds?**

1. Your browser established a connection with the server (handshake)
2. Exchanged security certificates (SSL/TLS)
3. Finally sent your actual order data

This is how **traditional HTTP/2 over TCP** works - it's like having to introduce yourself, shake hands, and exchange business cards before you can ask a simple question!

### Enter QUIC: The Modern Solution

QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) is like having a VIP pass:
- **No lengthy introductions** - you can start talking immediately (0-RTT)
- **Multiple conversations at once** - order food AND check your account without waiting
- **Better mobile experience** - switch from WiFi to cellular without reconnecting

**This project implements a reverse proxy using QUIC/HTTP/3**, making web applications faster, more reliable, and more scalable.

## 🔍 The Problem We're Solving

### Traditional Web Architecture Problems

#### Problem 1: Slow Initial Connections
```
Traditional TCP + TLS:
Client: "Hello, can we talk?"          → 50ms
Server: "Sure, here's my certificate"  → 50ms
Client: "Certificate verified, ready"  → 50ms
TOTAL: 150ms BEFORE any real data flows!

QUIC:
Client: "Hello + encrypted data"       → 50ms
Server: "Here's your response"         → 50ms
TOTAL: 100ms with data already sent! (or 0ms if previously connected)
```

#### Problem 2: Head-of-Line Blocking
Imagine you're in a single-file line at a coffee shop. The person in front orders a complex drink, and everyone behind them must wait, even if they just want water.

- **HTTP/2**: If one request is delayed, ALL requests on that connection wait
- **HTTP/3 (QUIC)**: Each request is independent - one slow request doesn't block others

#### Problem 3: Network Changes Kill Connections
You're on a train, watching a video:
- WiFi → Cellular network switch
- **Traditional TCP**: Connection drops, must reconnect (buffering...)
- **QUIC**: Connection migrates seamlessly, no interruption!

#### Problem 4: Single Server Overload
One server handling all traffic:
- ❌ Server crashes → entire application down
- ❌ Server overloaded → slow responses for everyone
- ❌ No redundancy → no maintenance possible

**Our reverse proxy solves this by:**
- ✅ Distributing traffic across multiple backend servers
- ✅ Automatic health checking (removes failing servers)
- ✅ Multiple load balancing strategies
- ✅ Zero-downtime deployments

## 🚀 What is QUIC?

### QUIC Explained Like You're Five

**Traditional Internet (TCP)**:
Think of sending a letter:
1. Write letter
2. Put in envelope
3. Seal envelope
4. Add address
5. Mail it
6. Wait for confirmation it arrived
7. Only then write the next letter

**QUIC (UDP-based)**:
Think of a phone call:
1. Dial once
2. Talk continuously
3. Multiple topics at once (multiplexing)
4. If you move to another room (network change), call continues

### Technical Comparison

| Feature | HTTP/1.1 | HTTP/2 (TCP) | HTTP/3 (QUIC) |
|---------|----------|--------------|---------------|
| **Transport** | TCP | TCP | UDP |
| **Connections per origin** | 6+ | 1 | 1 |
| **Multiplexing** | No | Yes | Yes (better) |
| **Head-of-line blocking** | Yes | Yes (TCP level) | No |
| **Connection setup** | 3 RTTs | 2-3 RTTs | 0-1 RTT |
| **Connection migration** | No | No | Yes |
| **Built-in encryption** | Optional | Optional | Mandatory |
| **Packet loss recovery** | Whole connection | Whole connection | Per stream |

### Key QUIC Advantages

#### 1. **0-RTT Resumption** (Zero Round Trip Time)
```
First Connection:
Client → Server: Hello + Key Exchange + HTTP Request
Server → Client: Response with data
(1-RTT connection)

Subsequent Connections (within ticket validity):
Client → Server: Encrypted Request (using cached keys)
Server → Client: Encrypted Response
(0-RTT - instant connection!)
```

#### 2. **Connection Migration**
Your unique connection is identified by a **Connection ID**, not IP address:
```
User on WiFi (192.168.1.5:5000) → Server
[Switch to cellular]
User on 4G (10.2.3.4:6000) → Server
Server: "Same Connection ID, continue seamlessly!"
```

#### 3. **Independent Streams**
```
Stream 1: Large image (100 packets)
Stream 2: Small CSS file (5 packets)
Stream 3: API request (2 packets)

If Stream 1 loses packet #50:
❌ HTTP/2: ALL streams wait for retransmission
✅ QUIC: Only Stream 1 waits, others continue!
```

#### 4. **Improved Congestion Control**
QUIC uses more advanced algorithms:
- **BBR** (Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT): Adapts to network conditions
- Per-stream flow control
- Faster loss detection and recovery

## 🔄 What is a Reverse Proxy?

### Simple Analogy: Restaurant Reception

**Without Reverse Proxy (Direct Access)**:
- Customers walk directly into the kitchen
- Chef #1 gets overwhelmed with orders
- Chef #2 sits idle
- Kitchen layout exposed to customers
- No way to handle chef breaks or sickness

**With Reverse Proxy (Our Project)**:
- Customers talk to receptionist (reverse proxy)
- Receptionist knows which chef is free
- Distributes orders evenly
- Checks if chefs are healthy (health checks)
- Customers never see the kitchen layout
- Can add/remove chefs without customers noticing

### Technical Explanation

```
[Client Browser] → [QUIC Reverse Proxy] → [Backend Server 1]
                                        → [Backend Server 2]
                                        → [Backend Server 3]
```

#### What the Reverse Proxy Does:

1. **Load Balancing** - Distributes requests across multiple servers
   - Round Robin: Server1 → Server2 → Server3 → Server1...
   - Least Connections: Choose server with fewest active connections
   - Random: Random selection (good for stateless apps)

2. **Health Checking** - Monitors server availability
   ```
   Every 10 seconds:
   Proxy → Server1: "Are you alive?" → Response: "Yes!" ✅
   Proxy → Server2: "Are you alive?" → No response ❌
   Proxy: "Mark Server2 as unhealthy, don't send traffic"
   ```

3. **SSL/TLS Termination** - Handles encryption/decryption
   - Client uses QUIC/TLS to proxy (encrypted)
   - Proxy can use HTTP to backends (faster internal network)
   - Or maintain TLS end-to-end for security

4. **Connection Pooling** - Reuses backend connections
   ```
   Without pooling:
   Request1 → New connection → Backend → Close
   Request2 → New connection → Backend → Close
   (Overhead: 100ms per connection)

   With pooling:
   Request1 → New connection → Backend → Keep alive
   Request2 → Reuse connection → Backend → Keep alive
   (Overhead: 5ms per request)
   ```

5. **Telemetry & Monitoring** - Collects metrics
   - Request counts, latencies, error rates
   - Backend health status
   - Connection pool statistics
   - Exports to Prometheus for visualization

### Request Flow (Step-by-Step)

```
1. Client initiates QUIC connection
   └→ Client: "QUIC handshake + HTTP/3 GET /api/users"

2. TLS verification & connection establishment
   └→ Proxy: "Verify certificate, establish QUIC streams"

3. Request reaches HTTP/3 handler
   └→ Proxy: "Parse HTTP/3 headers, extract path & method"

4. Route matching
   └→ Proxy: "Check config - does '/api/users' match any routes?"
   └→ Match found: route_id="api", backend_group="api-servers"

5. Load balancer selection
   └→ Proxy: "Which backend from 'api-servers' group?"
   └→ Algorithm: Round Robin → Next: server-2 (10.0.0.2:8002)
   └→ Check: Is server-2 healthy? Yes ✅

6. Backend connection
   └→ Proxy: "Get connection from pool or create new"
   └→ Connection reused from pool (faster!)

7. Forward request to backend
   └→ Proxy → Backend: "GET /api/users HTTP/1.1"

8. Backend processes & responds
   └→ Backend: "200 OK + JSON data"

9. Response sent back to client
   └→ Proxy → Client: "HTTP/3 200 OK + data over QUIC"

10. Telemetry recorded
    └→ Metrics: request_count++, latency=45ms, backend=server-2
    └→ Trace: Full request span with timing details
    └→ Logs: "INFO: Successfully proxied GET /api/users to server-2"
```

## ⚡ Key Features Explained

### 1. Multiple Load Balancing Strategies

#### Round Robin (Fair Distribution)
```yaml
strategy: round_robin
```
**How it works**: Requests distributed equally in order
```
Request 1 → Server A
Request 2 → Server B
Request 3 → Server C
Request 4 → Server A  (cycles back)
Request 5 → Server B
```
**Best for**: Servers with similar capacity, stateless applications

**Code snippet** (internal/proxy/balancer.go):
```go
func (rr *RoundRobinBalancer) NextBackend() *Backend {
    rr.current = (rr.current + 1) % len(rr.backends)
    return rr.backends[rr.current]
}
```

#### Least Connections (Smart Distribution)
```yaml
strategy: least_connections
```
**How it works**: Choose server with fewest active connections
```
Server A: 10 connections
Server B: 5 connections  ← Next request goes here
Server C: 8 connections
```
**Best for**: Long-lived connections, varying request complexity

**Code snippet**:
```go
func (lc *LeastConnectionsBalancer) NextBackend() *Backend {
    minConn := int(^uint(0) >> 1) // Max int
    var selected *Backend
    for _, backend := range lc.backends {
        if backend.ActiveConnections < minConn {
            minConn = backend.ActiveConnections
            selected = backend
        }
    }
    return selected
}
```

#### Random (Simple & Effective)
```yaml
strategy: random
```
**How it works**: Randomly select a healthy backend
```
Random selection: Server B
Random selection: Server A
Random selection: Server B
Random selection: Server C
```
**Best for**: Stateless applications, minimal overhead

### 2. Health Checking (Keep Your Backends Reliable)

#### Active Health Checks
Proxy **actively pings** backends periodically:

```yaml
health_check:
  enabled: true
  interval: 10s         # Check every 10 seconds
  timeout: 5s           # Wait max 5 seconds for response
  healthy_threshold: 2   # 2 successes = healthy
  unhealthy_threshold: 3 # 3 failures = unhealthy
  path: "/health"       # Endpoint to check
```

**Example scenario**:
```
Time 0s:  Check Server1 /health → 200 OK ✅ (fail_count=0)
Time 10s: Check Server1 /health → Timeout ❌ (fail_count=1)
Time 20s: Check Server1 /health → Timeout ❌ (fail_count=2)
Time 30s: Check Server1 /health → Timeout ❌ (fail_count=3)
         → MARK UNHEALTHY! No traffic to Server1

Time 40s: Check Server1 /health → 200 OK ✅ (success_count=1)
Time 50s: Check Server1 /health → 200 OK ✅ (success_count=2)
         → MARK HEALTHY! Resume traffic to Server1
```

#### Passive Health Checks
Monitor **real traffic** for errors:

```yaml
passive:
  enabled: true
  max_failures: 5       # 5 consecutive errors = unhealthy
  observation_window: 60s
```

**Example scenario**:
```
Request 1 → Server2 → 200 OK ✅ (error_count=0)
Request 2 → Server2 → 500 Error ❌ (error_count=1)
Request 3 → Server2 → 502 Bad Gateway ❌ (error_count=2)
Request 4 → Server2 → 200 OK ✅ (error_count=0, reset!)
Request 5 → Server2 → 500 Error ❌ (error_count=1)
...
After 5 consecutive errors → MARK UNHEALTHY!
```

### 3. Connection Pooling (Reuse for Speed)

**Without Connection Pooling**:
```
Client Request 1:
  Open TCP → TLS Handshake → Send Request → Receive → Close
  Time: 150ms

Client Request 2:
  Open TCP → TLS Handshake → Send Request → Receive → Close
  Time: 150ms

Total: 300ms for 2 requests
```

**With Connection Pooling**:
```
Client Request 1:
  Open TCP → TLS Handshake → Send Request → Receive → Keep Alive
  Time: 150ms

Client Request 2:
  Reuse Connection → Send Request → Receive → Keep Alive
  Time: 50ms (no handshake!)

Total: 200ms for 2 requests (33% faster!)
```

**Configuration**:
```yaml
connection_pool:
  max_idle_connections: 100    # Keep up to 100 idle connections
  max_connections_per_host: 10 # Max 10 to each backend
  idle_timeout: 90s            # Close idle after 90s
```

### 4. Telemetry (Know What's Happening)

#### Prometheus Metrics
Real-time numerical data:

```
# Request counter (total requests processed)
http_requests_total{method="GET",status="200",backend="server-1"} 1523

# Request duration histogram (latency distribution)
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.1"} 1200  # 1200 requests < 100ms
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.5"} 1500  # 1500 requests < 500ms

# Active connections gauge (right now)
active_connections{backend="server-1"} 42

# Backend health status
backend_healthy{backend="server-1"} 1  # 1=healthy, 0=unhealthy
```

**Metrics endpoint**: `http://localhost:9090/metrics`

#### OpenTelemetry Traces
Detailed request journey:

```
Trace: GET /api/users (trace_id: abc123)
├─ Span: quic_connection (2ms)
├─ Span: http3_parse (1ms)
├─ Span: route_match (0.5ms)
├─ Span: load_balance (0.2ms)
├─ Span: backend_request (45ms) ← Slowest part!
│  └─ Tags: backend=server-2, method=GET
└─ Span: response_send (3ms)

Total: 51.7ms
```

#### Structured Logs
Human & machine-readable logs:

```json
{
  "level": "info",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-14T10:30:45Z",
  "message": "Request proxied successfully",
  "request_id": "req-xyz789",
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/api/users",
  "backend": "server-2",
  "status": 200,
  "duration_ms": 45,
  "client_ip": "203.0.113.45"
}
```

### 5. Flexible Configuration (YAML-based)

```yaml
server:
  address: "0.0.0.0:443"        # Listen on all interfaces, port 443
  cert_file: "certs/server.crt" # TLS certificate
  key_file: "certs/server.key"  # TLS private key
  
routes:
  - id: "api-route"
    path: "/api/*"               # Match all /api/* requests
    backend_group: "api-servers" # Send to this group
    
  - id: "static-route"
    path: "/static/*"
    backend_group: "static-servers"

backend_groups:
  - id: "api-servers"
    strategy: "least_connections"  # Smart balancing
    backends:
      - url: "http://10.0.0.1:8001"
        weight: 100
      - url: "http://10.0.0.2:8002"
        weight: 100
    health_check:
      enabled: true
      interval: 10s
      path: "/health"
```

## 🌍 Real-World Use Cases

### Use Case 1: E-Commerce Website

**Scenario**: Online store with 10,000 concurrent users

**Setup**:
```yaml
backend_groups:
  - id: "product-api"
    strategy: "least_connections"
    backends:
      - url: "http://api1.internal:8080"  # 4 CPU, 8GB RAM
      - url: "http://api2.internal:8080"  # 4 CPU, 8GB RAM
      - url: "http://api3.internal:8080"  # 4 CPU, 8GB RAM
    health_check:
      path: "/health"
      interval: 5s
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ If one server crashes during checkout, traffic automatically routed to healthy servers
- ✅ QUIC's 0-RTT reduces latency for returning customers (faster page loads)
- ✅ Connection migration keeps mobile shoppers connected (WiFi → 4G)
- ✅ Telemetry shows which products cause slowdowns

### Use Case 2: Video Streaming Platform

**Scenario**: Users watch videos on mobile devices

**Setup**:
```yaml
backend_groups:
  - id: "video-cdn"
